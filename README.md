# twitter-sentiment-analysis

this repo includes my effort (alighazal) with my friend omer moussa on implementing twitter sentiment analysis. 

we compined two datasets: 

    1. TwitterSentiment1.6M from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
    2. 1.04M tweets Dataset: https://github.com/vineetdhanawat/twitter-sentiment-analysis

we reached an accuracy of 70% when we implemented the model using logistic regression compined with doc2vec embedding for tweets.
we experimneted with other models (read ml_project_phase3).

this repo lacks proper documentation. will work on this soon (hopefully).


you can read all the details of the process from the reports in this google drive:
